Title: Cryptographic Protection for SS7 over SIGTRAN using ChaCha20-Poly1305.
________________________________________
Abstract:
This report explores the application of modern cryptographic mechanisms to secure SS7 signaling over IP networks (SIGTRAN). Specifically, it focuses on using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm for authenticated encryption, addressing security challenges while maintaining performance, compatibility, and reliability in telecom networks.

1. Introduction
Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) is a critical communication protocol used in global telecom infrastructure. Designed in the 1970s, SS7 lacks built-in cryptographic protections, exposing it to a range of attacks including message interception, spoofing, and unauthorized subscriber tracking. With the adoption of SIGTRAN (SS7 over IP), there is an opportunity to enhance SS7's security using modern cryptographic standards.

2. Background
•	SS7: A suite of telecommunication protocols used for call setup, SMS, and roaming.
•	SIGTRAN: A protocol suite that transports SS7 messages over IP networks using SCTP.
•	ChaCha20-Poly1305: A modern authenticated encryption algorithm offering both confidentiality and integrity with minimal performance overhead.

3. The Need for Cryptographic Protection in SS7
SS7 was built on the assumption of a trusted network, but in today’s interconnected global environment, this assumption no longer holds. Attacks such as SMS interception and subscriber tracking have demonstrated the urgent need for cryptographic protection. Traditional solutions like SS7 firewalls and anomaly detection are insufficient for sophisticated attacks.

4. Why ChaCha20-Poly1305?
•	ChaCha20 is a stream cipher designed by Daniel J. Bernstein, known for its speed and security on software-based systems.
•	Poly1305 is a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) used to ensure integrity and authenticity.
•	Combined as ChaCha20-Poly1305, the algorithm provides Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).
Key Features:
•	Performance: Outperforms AES on platforms without hardware acceleration (e.g., mobile, embedded telecom nodes).
•	Security: Resistant to timing attacks due to constant-time operations.
•	Simplicity: Easy to implement and verify.
•	Adoption: Used in TLS 1.3, SSH, WireGuard, and more.

5. Application in SS7 over SIGTRAN
SS7 messages transported over IP via SIGTRAN can be secured at the adaptation or transport layers. ChaCha20-Poly1305 can be implemented as follows:
•	Transport Layer: Secure SCTP or SIGTRAN tunnel using ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption.
•	Payload Encryption: Encrypt MAP/TCAP/SCCP payloads using ChaCha20 and attach Poly1305 MAC for integrity.
•	Session Keys: Use Curve25519 (X25519) key exchange to derive session keys.

6. Performance Considerations
•	Low Latency: Minimal delay added to SS7 signaling.
•	CPU Efficiency: Ideal for legacy telecom equipment without AES-NI support.
•	Scalability: Suitable for high-throughput environments like STPs and roaming hubs.

7. Key Management Strategy
•	Session Key Exchange: Use X25519 (ECDH) for ephemeral key generation.
•	Key Rotation: Regular rotation to ensure forward secrecy.
•	Trust Model: Integrate with existing telecom trust hierarchies or PKI infrastructure.

8. Conclusion
The ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm provides a high-performance, secure, and compatible cryptographic solution for enhancing SS7 security in SIGTRAN-based deployments. By integrating authenticated encryption into legacy signaling systems, telecom operators can greatly reduce their exposure to critical vulnerabilities while maintaining operational efficiency.

Step-by-Step Algorithm
1. Start
2. Generate Secret Key
java
CopyEdit
byte[] key = new byte[32]; // 256-bit key
SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
random.nextBytes(key);
3. Generate Nonce
java
CopyEdit
byte[] nonce = new byte[12]; // 96-bit nonce
random.nextBytes(nonce);
4. Encrypt the SS7 Message
java
CopyEdit
SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, "ChaCha20");
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("ChaCha20-Poly1305");
ChaCha20ParameterSpec paramSpec = new ChaCha20ParameterSpec(nonce, 0);

cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey, paramSpec);
byte[] ciphertext = cipher.doFinal(SS7_Message);
5. Transmit Encrypted Data
•	Transmit:
o	ciphertext
o	nonce
o	key (shared securely in real-world via ECDH/Curve25519 or derived from session)
java
CopyEdit
sendOverNetwork(ciphertext, key, nonce);
6. Decrypt at Receiver
java
CopyEdit
SecretKey recvKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, "ChaCha20");
Cipher decryptCipher = Cipher.getInstance("ChaCha20-Poly1305");
ChaCha20ParameterSpec decryptParam = new ChaCha20ParameterSpec(nonce, 0);

decryptCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, recvKey, decryptParam);
byte[] decryptedMessage = decryptCipher.doFinal(ciphertext);
7. Message Received and Verified
java
CopyEdit
System.out.println("Verified SS7 Message: " + new String(decryptedMessage));
8. End
Hope it will help to secure ss7 .
